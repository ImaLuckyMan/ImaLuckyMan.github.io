<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![GitHub Pages][GitHub-Pages]](https://pages.github.com/)

I would like to make this information available to anyone whom hasn't seen it yet. Great for developers that are new and learning, designers and individuals that would like to portray their skill sets to potential employers, and a way to enhance your projects so that they are more memorable. 

Here's why:
* Everyone knows how to use the Web
* Extreamly Accessible
* Draws people attention and will stick with them longer than text. A picture is worth a thousand words.
